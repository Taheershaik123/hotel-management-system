# 🏨 Hotel Management System (C++ using Arrays)

This is a **console-based Hotel Management System** built entirely using **C++ and arrays**. It simulates basic hotel operations such as room booking, customer detail tracking, and bill generation. The goal of this project was to practice **core C++ programming concepts** like arrays, functions, loops, and conditionals — without object-oriented structures or external libraries.
